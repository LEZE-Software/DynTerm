# DynTerm
Welcome in the repository of the DynTerm-Project!

I work with microcontrollers and I always needed a terminal program which can work with individual content and displayes individual information depending on the received information.
Therefore I invented the "DynTerm"-tool. A tool which allows the user to build an individual form, create rules to process serial information and display the content the user needs.

Feel free to leave comments, issues or the participate on the project.
